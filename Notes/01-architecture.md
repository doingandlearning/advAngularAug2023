### Angular Architecture and Basics

#### 1. Recap of Angular Architecture
- Angular is a powerful front-end framework with a rich ecosystem.
- **Architectural Overview**:
  - Angular's architecture is modular and component-based.
  - The main building blocks are Modules, Components, Directives, and Services.
  - These units work together to build robust SPA (Single Page Applications).
- **Modular Design**: 
  - Promotes code reusability, maintainability, and better organization.
  - Allows lazy loading for faster startup times.

#### 2. Exploring the CLI
- Angular CLI is a command-line tool for Angular development.
- **Key Commands**:
  - `ng new`: Create a new application.
  - `ng generate` or `ng g`: Generate components, services, etc.
  - `ng serve`: Serve the application locally.

#### 3. Components
- **Components**:
  - Fundamental UI building blocks.
  - Combine HTML templates, styles, and business logic.
  - Declared using `@Component`.

#### 4. Directives
- Control and transform the DOM.
- Two main types:
  - **Structural Directives** (change the layout by adding/removing elements) e.g., `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`.
  - **Attribute Directives** (change the appearance or behavior of an element) e.g., `ngClass`, `ngStyle`.

#### 5. Services
- Central place for data or logic.
- Promote code reusability.
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**:
  - Inject services into components or other services.
  - Keeps the system modular and efficient.
  - Example: `CalculatorService` uses `LoggerService` for logging.

#### 6. Bindings and Data Passing
- Connect the component's class with the template.
- **Bindings Types**:
  - **Interpolation** (`{{}}`): Display component data.
  - **Property Binding** (`[property]`): Pass values from component to directive/component property.
  - **Event Binding** (`(event)`): Listen to DOM events and execute a method.
  - **Two-Way Binding** (`[(ngModel)]`): Synchronize data between model and view.
- **Data Passing**:
  - **@Input**: Parent to child component.
  - **@Output** & **EventEmitter**: Child to parent communication.

#### 7. Summary and Questions
- Angular is powerful, modular, and promotes organized, scalable code.
- Encourage experimenting with provided code examples to solidify understanding.
- Address any questions or ambiguities.

### Code Recap
- **CalculatorService**: Demonstrates service creation, methods, and service dependency (`LoggerService`).
- **Template Samples**:
  - Showcases interpolation, property binding, event binding, and two-way data binding.
  - Illustrates basic user interaction with buttons and forms.
  - Provides a glimpse into Angular's powerful form controls and directives.
